      <h3 id="Takeaways">My web design takeaways</h3>
      <!-- The ideas I learnt when doing these assignments. -->
      <p>Web design is a very useful course, which deserves to be reviewed to extract its core value. During this whole assignment 
        period, as a student, I learnt a lot.</p>
      <p>The first takeaway is that a universal CSS file can be applied across the whole website. This is an important feature that unifies
        the visual styles of all kinds of elements between different pages. Unified design style is almost compusary for general websites. 
        With a CSS file, the universal style can be set or adjusted with one line of code.
      </p>
      <p>The second takeaway is to always reference. In my own country, in a design work referencing other people's work is not as much
        emphsized as in Australia. This course and many other course keep pointing out the importance of referencing the ideas used for 
        your work. Besides reminding me of referencing itself, it lets me realize that in Australia plagiarism is definitely not tolerated.
        Someday in the future, if I failed to reference properly in my work, I may face serious result.
      </p>
      <p>The third takeaway is the widely accepted web structure. With the web design having developed for decades, a mature web structure
        is accepted by most web visitors and developers. Its typical features include a logo on the topleft corner, a navigation bar at the
        top, sitemap at the bottom, always present social network buttons, and so on. It would be easier and better understood if a website
        is designed following these features.
      </p>
      <p>Besides all the takeaways above, my gain of most value is the experience of the web development practice itself. Now I know I am 
        capable of designing a website, and with more practice I can make a living of it.
