      <!-- Some basic information about myself. -->
      <p>Hello, I am ZiLong Wang.</p>
      <p>As a student of Master of Computing, building webpages to express my interests is definitely my thing, but weak physical condition has also be a pain for me.</p>
      <p>After some effort and practice, I realised that working out in a gym is almost an essential activity for brain workers like us.</p>
      <p>I am not strong, not good at sports, not rich, and not very young, but I still benifits from it.</p>

      <!-- Why I chose this subject. -->
      <p>
        For a long period of time, I always easily felt tired and unconfident, so I got less productive in my study.
      </p>
      <p>
        I got the feeling that it was all because of the lack of exercise. My muscles were week, and my spirit was fragile. I needed to pull myself together.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some people may like football or badminton, but after consideration, I chose fitness to help me. 
        The first reason is that it is a single player exercise, I won't need to find other players to engage this game, so anything about it is more predictable. 
        The second reason is that it is purely constructive rather than competitive, so it can be more efficient on building my body.
        The third reason is that it comes with higher priority than other exercises, which means it is a prerequisite for other sports.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's has been more than a month since I began to work out again. Although the physical achievement is still unshown, but definitely I now have better confidence. 
        With the knowledge and newly-acquired experience, I would love to share what I got, to help other people.
      </p>
